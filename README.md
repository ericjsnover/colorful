# Colorful.css
Colorful is a simple yet elegant CSS color class library inspired by Google's Material Design palette

### Quick Use
Just click on the file called colorful.css and copy the code into your project. It will give you all of the classes using the default color palette. 

### Not sure where to start?
Clone the whole repository and check out the example.html file. 

### Run a LAMP server?
Check out the example.php which allows you to build your own tests and mess with the code.

### Got SASS?
All of the raw SASS files are available in the /includes directory and are imported into "colorful.scss". Once you've cloned the repo, start poking those files. Don't forget to check out the example.html (or example.php) file to learn about how to quickly change around the SASS.
